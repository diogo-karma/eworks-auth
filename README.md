# Trello's like by KARMA.yt

This project is a simple authentication experiment using Google, Apple, Email, and SMS, with an application similar to Trello. It is a comprehensive example of integrating Next.js with Supabase, Clerk, and Material UI to create a robust TODO application. It showcases CRUD operations, authentication, and a modern UI design.

## Overview

In this code, we will build a CRUD application by combining three major technologies. We will use Clerk for authentication, Supabase for the database, and Next.js as a framework.
You will also learn in this experiment:
 - How to create a Route Handler with the Next.js 14 App Router?
 - How to set up an authentication system with Clerk?
 - How to establish a Supabase connection with a JWT token?

We are also in the alpha phase of migrating to Tailwind CSS and integrating payment systems.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete your TODOs.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Clerk.
- **Database**: Supabase integration for backend storage.
- **UI**: Sleek user interface with Material UI.

## Getting Started

- Node.js
- pnpm, npm, or yarn
- Clerk and Supabase installations must be done, and the API keys must be in the .env.local file.
